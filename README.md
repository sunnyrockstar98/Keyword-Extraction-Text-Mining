# Keyword-Extraction-Text-Mining

Text mining is an amazing new branch of Data Science and this repo uses the famous Rake library in python to mine/extract keywords from the document - JavaBasics Notes!!

The pdf file is saved as .txt file for ease.

First you need to clone RAKE library in your computer and then import it in your script.
Next create an object and give the text file as input to the object with your desired parameters.

Parameters are:

1. MIN chars a keyword should have
2. MAX words a phrase can have
3. MIN number of times this keyword should occur.

Based on experimentation and nature of this document the parameters chosen are - (3,3,4)
